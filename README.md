In today’s digital age, having a strong online presence is vital for businesses that wish to remain competitive and accessible to their customers. EcoHarvest Fresh, a sustainable farm-to-table grocery store, seeks to expand its reach and improve customer engagement through a modern, functional, and visually appealing website. The proposed website will serve as a digital storefront, providing customers with detailed product information, seamless online ordering, and valuable educational resources about sustainability and healthy living. This project will not only showcase web development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also create a meaningful platform that aligns with EcoHarvest Fresh’s vision of promoting eco-friendly lifestyles.

Background of the Organisation

EcoHarvest Fresh was founded with the goal of bringing farm-fresh, sustainably grown produce directly to urban households. The company partners with local farmers who practice eco-friendly farming techniques, ensuring that every product is fresh, chemical-free, and responsibly sourced. Over the years, EcoHarvest Fresh has built a strong reputation in its local community for quality and sustainability. However, its current market reach remains limited due to the lack of a comprehensive digital platform. With the development of this website, EcoHarvest Fresh aims to strengthen its presence, attract a wider audience, and provide customers with convenient access to its products and services.

Mission and Vision

The mission of EcoHarvest Fresh is to make sustainable living accessible by offering affordable, fresh, and eco-friendly food products. Its vision is to become a leader in the sustainable food industry, inspiring communities to embrace healthier and greener lifestyles. The company’s values are rooted in environmental responsibility, customer well-being, and support for local farmers.

Website Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of the proposed website is to create an engaging, user-friendly platform that reflects the values of EcoHarvest Fresh while meeting the needs of its customers. Specific objectives include:

Providing an online catalogue of fresh produce and eco-friendly products.

Enabling online ordering and delivery options.

Sharing educational content on sustainability, eco-friendly practices, and healthy recipes.

Increasing brand visibility and attracting a wider customer base.

Building trust and loyalty through an intuitive and visually appealing digital experience.

Target Audience

The target audience includes environmentally conscious individuals, health-focused families, young professionals, and local community members who prefer convenient access to fresh produce. The website will also attract eco-conscious customers who value supporting local farmers and sustainable farming practices.

Proposed Website Features and Functionality

The EcoHarvest Fresh website will consist of the following key features:

Homepage: A welcoming page with a hero image, brand message, and call-to-action buttons.

About Us Page: Information about the company’s background, mission, and sustainable farming practices.

Products Page: An organised catalogue of fresh produce and eco-friendly items with images, descriptions, and prices.

Educational Blog/Recipes Page: Articles and recipes promoting healthy living and sustainable practices.

Contact Page: A user-friendly contact form, store locations, and business details.

Order/Enquiry Page: A simple system for customers to order or enquire about products.

Design and User Experience

The design will adopt a green and earthy colour palette (shades of green, brown, and cream) to reflect sustainability and freshness. Typography will use modern and clean fonts such as Poppins or Inter to ensure readability. The layout will follow a grid-based structure for clarity and organisation. User experience will be prioritised with simple navigation, clear calls to action, and a mobile-responsive design to ensure accessibility on all devices.

Technical Requirements

The website will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring responsiveness and interactivity. The domain name will reflect the brand identity and reliable hosting will be secured to ensure uptime and smooth performance. The site will be optimised for SEO to increase visibility on search engines.

Timeline and Milestones

Week 1–2: Research, content collection, and wireframe creation.

Week 3: Build basic HTML structure (header, navigation, footer, main sections).

Week 4: Apply CSS styling for branding and responsiveness.

Week 5: Add JavaScript functionality for interactivity (e.g., forms, navigation effects).

Week 6: Final testing, debugging, and deployment.
